# Webinar

## Data package design, featuring the candidate model for community survey data

September 26, 2017

### Description

This session was an informal discussion of the progress on EDI’s ecocomDP design pattern (https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP). EcocomDP was compared with the relational model used by the Popler project. Participants from that project attended the video meeting (Rice, et al, https://eco.confex.com/eco/2017/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/62280).
