## CZ Manager: software for sensor and sample based earth observations

August 17, 2021

### Description

CZ Manager is a graphical user interface (GUI) for [Observations Data Model 2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.01.010) (ODM2). This software was originally developed for managing data collected from the field in Luquillo, Puerto Rico for the NSF funded [Critical Zone Observatory program](https://criticalzone.org/) and continues to be used primarily for sensor-based data collected by the [Luquillo LTER](https://luquillo.lter.network/). CZ Manager is also in use for sensor and sample-based data from the waterways of the New Hampshire Great Bay region as part of the Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership (PREP). CZ Manager includes a suite of tools for mapping sites, plotting data, managing data QA/QC, and Water OneFlow web services (WaterML) for integration with data.cuahsi.org.
