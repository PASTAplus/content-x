## Update on the EMLassemblyline – an R package for creating metadata in EML

January 19, 2021

### Description

EMLassemblyline (EAL) is an R library for programmatically creating EML metadata. It is optimal for recurring data publications (time series or data derived from time series sources) but works well for “one-off” publications. EAL prioritizes automated metadata extraction from data objects to minimize required human effort and encourages EML best practices to make data publications Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

This webinar provided an introductory overview and demonstration of EAL while highlighting its newest features.
