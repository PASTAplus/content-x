## Organizing data into publishable units

July 31, 2018

### Description

Organizing data into publishable units can be challenging because itâ€™s often influenced by multiple factors including: data theme and volume, the unique needs of providers and users, the level of processing required, and the general purpose the data serve. To inform a set of guidelines for organizing data into publishable units we had an open discussion to share experiences, issues, and recommendations.
