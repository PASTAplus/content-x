## Using checksums to speed up data package uploads

November 28, 2017

### Description

A new option is now available in the Data Portal for speeding up data package uploads to PASTA. When selected, the “useChecksum” option allows PASTA to use an existing copy of a data entity if its checksum matches the checksum documented in your EML metadata. This tutorial covers the effective use of this potential time-saving option and is intended for Information Managers who use the Data Portal interface to upload data packages to PASTA.
