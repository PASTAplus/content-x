## A workflow for automating the update of continuous data in EDI using GitHub actions

September 21, 2021

### Description

An autonomous data processing/publishing workflow driven by GitHub actions is presented. The workflow downloads data from the Southern and Central & Northern California Ocean Observing Systems, [SCCOOS](https://sccoos.org/) and [CeNCOOS](https://www.cencoos.org/) respectively, transforms the data, then publishes to the EDI Data Repository and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)). This workflow can be generalized for other data processing/publishing use cases.
