## Clean your taxonomy data with the taxonomyCleanr R package

January 16, 2018

### Description

Taxonomic data can be messy and challenging to work with. Incorrect spelling, the use of common names, unaccepted names, and synonyms, contribute to ambiguity in what a taxon actually is. The taxonomyCleanr R package helps you resolve taxonomic data to a taxonomic authority, get accepted names and taxonomic serial numbers, as well as create metadata for your taxa in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) format.
