## Postgres, EML and R in a data management workflow 

May 8, 2018

### Description

Metadata storage and creation of EML have been always a challenge for people/organizations who want to archive their data. A workflow was developed to combine efficient EML record generation using the package developed by the R community with the advantages of centrally-controlled metadata in a relational database (metabase). We will focus on two components of the workflow in this webinar: 1. display the metadata storage in a relational database; and 2. one example of EML file generation using pre-defined R functions.
