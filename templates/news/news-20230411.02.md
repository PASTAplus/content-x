## Journal Citation interface refresh

April 11, 2023

### Description

EDI has recently updated its **Journal Citation** interface to include paged views of managed citations when the number
of citations grows larger than 10: You may now select between 10, 25, 50, or 100 citations per page. This fits nicely
now with a fully revised interface to create, modify, or delete individual citations. Prior to this change,
modifications to existing citations were not possible. This new interface sports a pop-up dialog that captures the
essential information for describing a journal citation of your data package. Citation information is added to the data
package DataCite metadata and is propagated to DataCite when you add or modify the information. Similarly, a journal
citation is removed from the DataCite metadata if you delete the journal citation. We welcome any feedback on this new
and improved interface.
