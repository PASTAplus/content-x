### Description

The EDI Repository API facilitates automated data processing and publication workflows, thereby enabling reproducible and efficient data package management. Four new R functions have been added to the [EDIutils R library](https://github.com/EDIorg/EDIutils) supporting package reservation (pkg_reserve_id.R), evaluation (pkg_evaluation.R), upload (pkg_upload.R), and update (pkg_update.R). The full suite of PASTA+ API calls from the R environment will be available soon!
