## New Resource for Information Managers: [Adding Physical Metadata](/templates/resources/adding-physical-metadata.md)

May 19, 2022

### Description

Physical metadata such as file size, MD5 checksum, and number of rows in a table, are important pieces of information. This information is not only useful to future users who are assessing fitness of a data package for reuse, but also can be used to verify the integrity of files after uploads and downloads. When a resource is uploaded to ezEML or processed by EMLassemblyline, this information is automatically calculated. However, neither application can obtain this information from a file that is not accessible. The responsibility is instead placed on the data provider to determine and manually enter this physical metadata.

This resource, which demonstrates calculating physical metadata and how to add physical metadata to an EML document, will be useful for information managers or data authors who want to implement a fully-offline workflow for publishing web-hosted data, or who need to publish prohibitively large data offline.
