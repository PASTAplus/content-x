## New Guidelines for Defining Data Package Replication

October 9, 2024

Colin Smith

### Description

Ensuring data consumers are aware of replicated data across repositories is crucial for reducing data user confusion, data misuse and errors, and inefficiencies for data harvesters.

The [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/eml-ecological-metadata-language) (EML v2.2.0) offers a semantic annotation feature suitable for defining data replication, applicable to both entire data packages and specific data entities within a package. This functionality in combination with the [schema:sameAs](https://schema.org/sameAs) property enables a solution for indicating replicated data resources that align with [Science-On-Schema.Org](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md) conventions, promoting dataset discovery and interoperability.

The full version of the guidelines are available [here](/templates/resources/defining-data-replication.md).
