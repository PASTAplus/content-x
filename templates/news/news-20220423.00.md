### Description

We are happy to announce the EDIutils R package (an API Client for the Environmental Data Initiative Repository) has been accepted by [rOpenSci](https://docs.ropensci.org/EDIutils/). As a result, the project GitHub has moved and installation has changed to `remotes::install_github("ropensci/EDIutils")`. We will be submitting to CRAN in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!
