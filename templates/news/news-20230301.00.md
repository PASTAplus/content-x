### Description

However, the future is bright, and we look forward to alternative approaches of supporting information management and data science in the community. Please subscribe to our [newsletter](https://environmentaldatainitiative.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c258a774cbd4d34290410d1ea&id=da346b264c) for opportunities.
