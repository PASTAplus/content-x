## New ezEML Collaboration Features Allow Multiple Users to Edit the Same Data Package

### Description

EDI has released new ezEML features to let multiple users collaborate in creating, maintaining, and curating ezEML documents.

#### Collaborate with Others

Every ezEML document is stored in the account of the user who created the document – the document’s "owner." It’s often useful, however, to invite one or more colleagues to collaborate in editing, reviewing, and managing a document. 

The new Collaborate feature lets you invite other users to collaborate with you on an ezEML document you own. After those users accept their invitations, they can access the document in ezEML just as they would if they were the document's owner. A locking mechanism keeps multiple collaborators from editing the same document simultaneously, safeguarding against the corruption of its contents.

#### Enable EDI Curation

Building on the Collaborate feature, the new Enable EDI Curation feature establishes a group collaboration with the EDI Data Curation Team, letting EDI’s curators access your ezEML data package directly to review it and prepare it for final submission to the EDI data repository. 

Previously, submitting a data package required the Send to EDI feature, which resulted in data packages being emailed back and forth. With Enable EDI Curation, EDI’s curators can work directly in your account, streamlining the process and ensuring that you’ll have the finished product in your ezEML account when they've completed their work. Automatic backups will preserve the package in its original form before the curators make modifications.
