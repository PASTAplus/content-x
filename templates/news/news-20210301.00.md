## EDI Supports Temporary Data Embargoes Upon Request

March 1, 2021

### Description

You may not know that the Environmental Data Initiative provides an embargo service to temporarily block access to data tables (and other types of data) in your EDI uploaded data packages, but it does. We provide this service to satisfy requirements of many journals who request that data accompanying a manuscript be archived in a recognized data repository and assigned a valid Digital Object Identifier (DOI) before the manuscript is reviewed. It is often the case that the journal or manuscript author prefers that the data be off limits to the general public until the manuscript is fully published. For this reason, EDI will apply a temporary embargo on the data elements of your data package (metadata, however, are not permitted to be embargoed) at your request â€“ all you have to do is ask through our support email address or directly on our Slack channel. We will remove the embargo once you let us know that the manuscript has been published. The best part is that the DOI remains the same before and after the embargo. Because EDI is a strong proponent of publicly accessible data, we will periodically reach out to owners of embargoed data to confirm the continued need of the embargo. Lastly, please let us know if and how we can improve this service.
