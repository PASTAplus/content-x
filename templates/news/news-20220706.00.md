## DeX in production

July 6, 2022

### Description

Our new data exploration tool called “DeX” for use with published data is in production now. It provides a text and graphical summary of each variable/column in a data table within a dataset, a data sub-setting tool, and simple graphing capabilities.   To access the tool, go to [https://edirepository.org](https://edirepository.org/) “Find Data” and “EDI Dataset Search.” Once you have located a data package, hitting the “Explore Data” button next to each of the data tables will show you the profile/summary for that table. The menu on the top of the page provides access to the subset and plot functions. For more information see also ["A Quick Overview of EDI’s Data Explorer (DeX)"](https://edirepository.org/news/news-20220128.00).

We hope you will find it to be useful and/or can provide feedback on how to make it even more useful.  As always, the main page for a data package (the page with the Explore Data buttons), also has code generation for Matlab, Python, R, SAS, SPSS and the “Tidy” version of R for programs to analyze the data.
