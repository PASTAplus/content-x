# Find Data

## For Data Users 

Data users search, access, integrate, and cite data from the EDI Repository to contextualize new research, synthesize data, ask new questions of old data, etc. Typically, the use of data from the EDI Repository results in the publication of a derived data package in which the data sources are referenced by provenance metadata or are cited in a journal publication.

Start searching for data right now with EDI's [**Advanced Data Search**](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp) 

If you're new to EDI, learn about our tools for finding and accessing data at [resources for data users](/templates/resources/resources-for-data-users.md).
