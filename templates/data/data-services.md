# Data Services

We provide **comprehensive research data support** for departments, research groups and projects, including for proposal writing and grant execution. **Our goal** is to maximize the value of research data and catalyze new research opportunities.

Managing data for new science requires specialized expertise and significant human effort. The Environmental Data Institute is ready to provide efficient support with data scientists trained in environmental science and a certified data repository.

**Our services** are available through support packages with costs related to the complexity of the project. Ask for a free consultation.



1. **Data management plan development and consultation** at no cost.
2. **Data publication support: **Publication of research data, create [personalized data catalogs](https://edirepository.org/resources/create-a-data-catalog), and [reports to funders](https://edirepository.org/resources/reporting-to-funders). (~10K)
3. **Prepare data for analysis:** Harmonize format and structure of data from diverse sources, spanning disciplines and institutional and governmental borders, to ensure that the data are compatible for facilitating analysis (for tasks see table).

Examples of analysis ready data (link). **Hours and cost estimates** as determined by projectâ€™s complexity:
