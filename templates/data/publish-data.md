## Work with our Data Curation Team

Submissions can be sent in one of two ways:

1. Use the [ezEML](https://ezeml.edirepository.org/eml/) metadata editor to describe and submit your data. [A short video on ezEML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhtq7iSQIyM).
2. Send EML metadata and data files as email attachments or downloadable links to [info@environmentaldatainitiative.org](mailto:info@environmentaldatainitiative.org). For more information on EML see [creating metadata for publication](/templates/resources/creating-metadata-for-publication.md).

We will get back to you ASAP, usually within 24 hrs, and begin [the review process](/templates/resources/the-review-process.md). For more information on types of contribution and preparing for submission, see the [resources for data authors](/templates/resources/resources-for-data-authors.md). Please [contact us](/templates/support/contact-us.md) if you have any questions.
