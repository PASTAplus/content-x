# How to Submit Your Data

## Work with our Data Curation Team

We have two options for submitting data to the EDI Curation Team:

1. [ezEML](https://ezeml.edirepository.org/eml/) - A form-based online tool for creating metadata in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML). [Hereâ€™s a short video to help you get started with ezEML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhtq7iSQIyM).
2. [EDI Metadata Template](https://environmentaldatainitiative.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/edi_metadata_template.docx) - A MS Word file for your metadata. Fill it out and send it back to us with your data, at [info@environmentaldatainitiative.org](mailto:info@environmentaldatainitiative.org).

We will get back to you A.S.A.P., usually within 24 hours. [Contact us](https://web-x.edirepository.org/support/contact-us) with any questions or if you need help getting started.

## For Information Managers

You are welcome to manage upload of your data and metadata to our repository. The [Resources for Information Managers](https://web-x.edirepository.org/resources/resources-for-information-managers) is your guide to this process. Please [contact us](https://web-x.edirepository.org/support/contact-us) for more information or [login to your EDI Data Portal account](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/login.jsp).
