Currently our 2022 Fellowship Program is ongoing. The Fellows are gaining data publishing experience for specific host sites, spanning diverse ecosystems across the country, from Maine’s Mount Desert Island to Puerto Rico’s Luquillo Mountains to the Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. For more information.

Please contact Susanne Grossman-Clarke, EDI’s Outreach and Training Coordinator with any questions regarding the fellowship program: grossmanclar@wisc.edu.

##Overview

During the 2-month summer program, the Fellows receive training in environmental data management by EDI and gain hands-on experience through participation in data publishing with specific host projects, either remotely or on site. In agreement with EDI’s mission of accelerating curation and publishing of environmental data, the focus of the fellowship program is on:

* Processing and publishing the host projects’ data.
* Creating workflows that support the processing of data collections. See here for an example.
