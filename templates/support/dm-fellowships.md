# EDI Data Management Fellowship Program

### _Due to a change in focus, we are pausing the EDI Fellowship Program until further notice and will place our effort towards alternative approaches of supporting information management and data science in the community. We appreciate all of the recent inquiries about the Fellowship Program and apologize for any inconvenience due to our decision.
