#### About

We successfully completed our third EDI Summer Fellowship Program (9 June – 14 August 2020). Due to the COVID-19 health situation, we moved the entire program online, including the ecological data publishing training for the fellows. We supported ten fellows who conducted data management and publishing work for host sites located in different parts of the country. For a list of host sites, on-site mentors and fellows, see below. Thanks to the fellows’ and mentors’ effort to regularly meet online, the fellowship was successful in terms of learning about data management and working with scientific teams of the host sites. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, for long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the [EDI data repository](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp), [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) and by internet searches).

For an example of the fellows' engagement with the host projects, see Ashley Whipple’s (fellow with the Pepperwood Preserve) blog entry on [“My data’s data: a metadata story”](https://www.pepperwoodpreserve.org/2020/07/30/mydatasdata-a-metadata-story/).

#### Host projects and mentors for training program

* #### [Baylor University, Center for Aquatic Systems Research (CRASR)](https://www.baylor.edu/crasr/). Location: Remote. Mentor: Stephen Powers (s_powers@baylor.edu), Fellow: Jessica Hicks
    * **Project description:** CRASR facilitates research on aquatic systems inclusive to biogeochemistry, ecology, and human health considerations. CRASR operates a shared water chemistry lab that applies analytical methods supported by EPA guidance (e.g., total phosphorus, major ions) to analyze many thousand samples each year. The Fellow will synthesize, disseminate and publish a variety of CRASR water data. Three existing datasets involve water quality monitoring of surface water bodies of Central Texas: Lake Waco (biogeochemistry, vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen and water temperature) and Richland-Chambers Reservoir (continuous sensor data from multi-parameter sondes). Depending on the Fellow’s interest, many other CRASR water datasets are available for archiving. In summer 2021, CRASR plans to begin disseminating data subsets using an online Rshiny data dashboard and the Fellow could be part of the development.
