#### About

We successfully completed our third EDI Summer Fellowship Program (9 June – 14 August 2020). Due to the COVID-19 health situation, we moved the entire program online, including the ecological data publishing training for the fellows. We supported ten fellows who conducted data management and publishing work for host sites located in different parts of the country. For a list of host sites, on-site mentors and fellows, see below. Thanks to the fellows’ and mentors’ effort to regularly meet online, the fellowship was successful in terms of learning about data management and working with scientific teams of the host sites. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, for long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the [EDI data repository](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp), [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) and by internet searches).

For an example of the fellows' engagement with the host projects, see Ashley Whipple’s (fellow with the Pepperwood Preserve) blog entry on [“My data’s data: a metadata story”](https://www.pepperwoodpreserve.org/2020/07/30/mydatasdata-a-metadata-story/).
