## About

We successfully completed our fourth EDI Fellowship Program (21 June – 19 August 2021). Due to the COVID-19 health situation, we conducted the data publishing training online. Most of the Fellows engaged with the host projects remotely. We supported 16n fellows who conducted data management and publishing work for host projects located in different parts of the country and Costa Rica. For a list of host sites, on-site mentors and fellows, see below. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, developing publishing workflows and to long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the EDI repository, DataONE and by internet searches).
