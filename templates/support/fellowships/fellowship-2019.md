## About

We successfully completed our second EDI Summer Fellowship Program (10 June – 9 August 2019). We supported nine fellows at host sites located in different parts of the country, studying a large variety of ecosystems, with the host institutions differing in size and data management resources. For a list of host sites, on-site mentors and fellows, see below.

In addition to data publishing, we worked with the fellows and the host project mentors on matching EDI’s data publishing services with the site’s data publishing needs, so that a plan for a longer-term data publishing strategy was in place when the fellows left. EDI will provide continued support to the host sites in maintaining the already archived data packages as well as in future data publishing efforts.

Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, for long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the [EDI data repository](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp), [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) and by internet searches) as well as to fulfill the requirements of scientific journals and funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation. We also supported the development and publishing of a workflow for marine image analysis.

#### Highlights

* EDI workshop on “Introduction to publishing environmental data” at [Clemson Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/research/baruch/) with support of EDI fellow Vanessa Bailey.
* Fellow Katherine Qi with NES LTER shared her work in teleconferences with NASA, [Integrated Ocean Observing System](https://ioos.noaa.gov/), and [Marine Biodiversity Observation Network](https://sbc.marinebon.org/) scientists and data managers. She developed workflows to contribute datasets from plankton imaging systems to EDI.
* Fellows Katherine Le and Alexis Garretson continue to work with their former host sites, [Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station](https://www.lacawac.org/) and [Mohonk Preserve](https://www.mohonkpreserve.org/) on data management related tasks.
* Several fellows presented their results at conferences with partial travel support from EDI.
* Two data packages published by EDI fellows were featured in our “Featured Data Package” series, [“Mohonk Preserve Amphibian and Water Quality Monitoring Dataset at 11 Vernal Pools from 1931-Present”](https://edirepository.org/featured/featured-20190701.00) and [“Monthly litterfall, monthly tree band, and annual tree growth of a South Carolina coastal wetland forest”](https://edirepository.org/featured/featured-20190901.00).

#### Testimonials

“I benefited greatly from the EDI summer fellowship program. The workshop in Albuquerque exposed me to data concepts that I hadn’t thought of before and improved my knowledge of data management best practices. Learning about metadata and the Ecological Metadata Language prepared me to help the people at the Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science with their data. Working with data at the field station further gave me hands-on experience with different ecological data, their nuances, and associated troubleshooting. EDI support allowed the repository upload process to occur smoothly. I’ve made so many wonderful connections with other ecologists and data managers from this program. I feel extremely fortunate for the opportunity and hope to apply the skills I learned to my own data management in the future.”
