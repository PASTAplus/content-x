<img src="/static/images/lter-logo.svg" alt="The US LTER Network Logo" width="40%">

The US LTER Network was founded in 1980 by the National Science Foundation with the recognition that long-term research could help unravel the principles and processes of ecological science, which frequently involves long-lived species, legacy influences, and rare events. As policymakers and resource managers strive to incorporate reliable science in their decision-making, the LTER Network works to generate and share useful and usable information.

<img src="/static/images/datacite-logo.png" alt="The DataCite Logo" width="25%">

DataCite is a leading global non-profit organization that provides persistent identifiers (specifically
DOIs) for research data and other research outputs. Organizations within the research community join
DataCite as members to assign DOIs to all their research outputs. This allows their outputs to become
discoverable, citable, and connected. Associated metadata is made available to the community and
DataCite develops additional services to connect and share research outputs with the broader research
ecosystem.

Founded in 1889 as New Mexico’s flagship institution, The University of New Mexico (UNM) now occupies nearly 800 acres near old Route 66 in the heart of Albuquerque, a metropolitan area of more than 900,000 people. From the magnificent mesas to the west, past the banks of the historic Rio Grande to the Sandia Mountains to the east, Albuquerque is a blend of culture and cuisine, styles and stories, people, pursuits and panoramas.

Offering a distinctive campus environment with a Pueblo Revival architectural theme, the campus buildings echo nearby Pueblo Indian villages. The nationally recognized campus arboretum and the popular duck pond offer an outstanding botanical experience in the midst of one of New Mexico's great public open spaces.

## Government Agencies

<br>

<img src="/static/images/nsf_logo.png" alt="The U.S. National Science Foundation" width="15%">

The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports science and engineering in all 50 states and U.S. territories. NSF was established in 1950 by Congress to: Promote the progress of science; Advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; Secure the national defense. We fulfill our mission chiefly by making grants. Our investments account for about 25% of federal support to America's colleges and universities for basic research: research driven by curiosity and discovery. We also support solutions-oriented research with the potential to produce advancements for the American people.
