# The REST API

The [REST API](https://pastaplus-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc_tree/about.html) offers solutions for programmatically interacting with the EDI Data Repository. For any functionality that can be manually handled in the EDI Data Portal (evaluating, uploading, searching, etc.), there is a corresponding REST API operation that can be used to automate the process.

The API is divided into two main categories. The [Data Package Manager API](https://pastaplus-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc_tree/pasta_api/data_package_manager_api.html) consists of operations involved with publishing and accessing data packages. The [Audit manager API](https://pastaplus-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc_tree/pasta_api/audit_manager_api.html) is used to create and provide access to user Audit logs. The [API documentation](https://pastaplus-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc_tree/pasta_api/index.html) contains all the information to start using the API operations.

For users who prefer to work in an R environment, the [EDIutils](https://ediorg.github.io/EDIutils/) R package is a client wrapping the REST API that offers all of the API operations as R functions.
