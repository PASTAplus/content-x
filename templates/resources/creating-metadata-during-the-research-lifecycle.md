# Creating Metadata During the Research Life Cycle

Our experiences as data curators and scientists have shown that continuous creation of metadata during the research life cycle greatly benefits data management during a project and when it comes time to publish data when the project concludes.

The [ezEML](https://ezeml.edirepository.org/eml/) and [EMLassemblyline](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/) applications can be used to gather metadata throughout the research life cycle. Collected metadata can be exported and rendered into a human readable form with the [Metadata Previewer](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataPreviewer.jsp) at any time for immediate use, or when later publishing to the EDI Data Repository. Alternatively, use the [EDI Metadata Template](https://github.com/EDIorg/MetadataTemplates) to gather metadata in a Microsoft Word (.docx) file. This file cannot be automatically translated to the EML format required for publication by the EDI Repository.
