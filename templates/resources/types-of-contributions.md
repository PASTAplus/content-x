# Types of Contributions

EDI publishes data from the ecological and environmental sciences irrespective of funding origin. Contributions serve a multitude of use cases and are open access unless a compelling reason warrants an embargo. Limits on size of publications are typically not a concern, but if so, we can find a workable solution.

## Supported disciplines and themes {#supported-disciplines-and-themes}

We accept all ecological and environmental data irrespective of origin, however, the discovery and reuse of data from an ecology or environmental science sub-theme may be better served by a more specialized and finely scoped data repository (e.g. [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)).

>EDI [thematic standardization projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7bwrrnlKlagUSQ_IZtjoLCulbRu9AKPEFXr--iA4Lo/edit?usp=sharing) replicate data to matching data repositories for enhanced discovery and reuse.


## Common use cases {#common-use-cases}

Data published in the EDI Repository serve many scientific use cases, including:



* [Data supporting a journal article](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=1077)
* [Data supporting general reuse](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-jrn.210365001.62)
* [New data derived from previously published data](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.303.2)
* [Citizen science](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=949)
* [Education](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=270)


## Accepted data types and file formats {#accepted-data-types-and-file-formats}

The EDI Data Repository accepts data of all types and file formats, though non-proprietary formats are strongly recommended to enable open access and reuse. Some examples:



* [Tables](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=1078)
* [Spatial data](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=98)
* [Images/video](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-vcr.239.3)
* [Scripts/code](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=1064)
* [NetCDF](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-nwt.171.1)


## Open access vs. embargoed {#open-access-vs-embargoed}

All published data are immediately made open access, and only under specific circumstances may data be published in an embargoed form. For more on embargoes see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zuFCD80AU5AKcoUhHjo0VegvoFBpAo_4HvD4GuGmjBA/edit#heading=h.64w58oz738es). Please contact us if you have a use case for which an embargo should be considered.


## Upload size limit {#upload-size-limit}

There is a soft limit of 500 MB and hard limit of 100 GB per data package. The 500 MB limit can be relaxed by contacting the EDI Data Curation Team and avoided entirely by information managers with an EDI account and [uploading with static data links](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DC403Wd6PfssjPXl-ToRNlC97xcr6kVoTWoFE4R2_bk/edit#heading=h.3yagd380wsrl). For data packages exceeding 100 GB please see the recommendations for [publishing large datasets](https://ediorg.github.io/data-package-best-practices/datapackage-design/large-data-sets.html) or contact us to find a solution.


## Fees {#fees}

Publication to the EDI Data Repository is currently free of cost for most use cases. If expecting to publish large volumes of data please contact us to negotiate cost sharing.
