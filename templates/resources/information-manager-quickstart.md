## Sign-up for an EDI Account

An EDI account enables direct upload to the EDI Data Repository and access to advanced features. To get an account, [email the EDI Data Curation Team](/templates/support/contact-us.md) with the subject line "New EDI account request" and brief answers these questions:

* What data formats do you plan to publish? (e.g. tabular, spatial, other)
* What is the total approximate volume of data you would like to publish now? (e.g. megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes)
* What is the expected approximate volume of data you'd like to publish annually? (e.g. megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes)
* Do you currently document your data with a metadata standard? If so, what standard?â€‹ (e.g. EML, ISO-19115)
* Briefly describe why you choose EDI and any data management/publishing goals we may be able to help with.

You should receive a response within 24 hours.

## Resources

The [resources for information managers](/templates/resources/resources-for-information-managers.md) pages provide support to information management tasks occurring throughout the research life cycle and emphasize data curation best practices.

Technologies and sub-projects of EDI are managed within two GitHub organizations. These are open source and community driven projects. Open new issues to report bugs and request features. Contributions are always welcome.



* [PASTAplus](https://github.com/PASTAplus) - Data repository code and micro services
* [EDIorg](https://github.com/EDIorg) - Data curation tools, thematic harmonization projects, best practices, etc.

We recommend checking out the LTER, and NCEAS GitHub organizations for EDI use cases and general inspiration.



* [lter](https://github.com/lter) - Projects in this organization support ecological research, coordination, and communication by and related to the LTER Network.
* [NCEAS](https://github.com/NCEAS) - National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis

Additionally, see the DataONE GitHub organization for more data management resources and tools. EDI is a member of the DataONE Network so many of the resources provided there pertain to data published in the EDI Data Repository.
