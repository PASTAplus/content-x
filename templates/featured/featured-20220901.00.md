### Description

We awarded 14 fellowships for our fifth ecological data management training program (20 June - 19 August 2022). The Fellows received training in ecological data management during a three-day online data publishing workshop and gained hands-on experience through participation in data preparation and publishing with scientists and information managers from specific host research projects, spanning diverse ecosystems across the country, from Maine’s Mount Desert Island to Puerto Rico’s Luquillo Mountains to the Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. Our Fellows published a number of data packages.

The projects included LTER and Forest Services sites (i.e. [Jornada Basin LTER](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/) and [Marcell Experimental Forest](https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/ef/marcell/)), citizen science projects such as [Journey North](https://journeynorth.org/) and the [Charleston Community Research to Action Board (CCRAB)](https://www.facebook.com/CCRABSC/), serving environmental justice communities in Charleston, South Carolina. For more information on this year's host projects, visit the website on the [2022 Fellowship Program](/support/fellowship-2022). More data packages will be completed soon and added to the list below.
