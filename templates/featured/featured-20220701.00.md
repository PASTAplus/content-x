### Description

This data package contains weekly water quality data from the Quebrada Sonadora and El Verde streams in Puerto Rico and is one of EDI's long-term, continuous data sets. Stream water sampling began in 1983, with the [https://luquillo.lter.network/](Luquillo Long-term Ecological Research Project) taking on sampling in 1988 and continuing to do so. Puerto Rico’s Luquillo site (LUQ) entered the LTER program in 1988 to study the long-term effects of natural and human disturbances on tropical forests and streams in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (Figure 1).

for stream water that is collected weekly at the Luquillo Mountain sites listed below. 

Stream water samples are grab samples taken from the water/air interface at stream channel center on the sampling day (usually Tuesdays). 

A continuous record of stream stage (height) is recorded by a datalogger at all ongoing stream sampling sites. Average daily streamflows are available from the USGS and at other locations (Hydrology and Meteorology) on this site. All samples are measured for pH and conductivity, and then filtered (pre-combusted Whatman GF/F glass fiber filter) prior to further analysis. From 1983-1994 samples were cooled and returned to the San Juan chemistry laboratory for analysis. During those years, samples for NH4 and NO3 analyses were refrigerated continuously until analysis. Subsamples for NH4 analysis were also preserved with 1 molar H2SO4. From 1994 on, samples for NH4 and NO3were frozen until analysis, were not acidified, and all analyses were conducted at the University of New Hampshire. Stream water Sampling SitesDescriptions of LTER LUQ stream water weekly sample chemistry data from 1988 onwards. Chemical concentrations are recorded as mg/L or mg/L as appropriate. Values below detection limits are recorded as 1/2 the detection limit.  Site Abbreviation Description Comments Quebrada Sonadora QS El Verde stream.   Quebrada Toronja QT = QT1 El Verde stream.

Standardized Aquatic Microcosms are model ecosystems or synthetic microcosms that allow investigators to control variables such as initial organisms, species assemblage, relative abundances as well as the nature of the liquid medium, being chemically defined.

Microcosms constitute moderately complex assemblages of organisms that fulfill important ecological roles in aquatic communities. Even though the initial conditions are controlled, the biological components soon modify the system in complex ways. Replicate systems can be established simultaneously and randomly assigned to treatment groups.

The data featured here were obtained from an investigation of the effects of copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>) toxicity on aquatic systems consisting of multiple phytoplankton and animals in a chemically defined medium that followed the Standardized Aquatic Microcosm protocol (ASTM 2012). Four different laboratories conducted a total of ten experiments to test the reproducibility of results to control, low, medium and high concentrations of CuSO<sub>4</sub>.

The protocol included the same 10 species of phytoplankton and 5 animals, including Daphnia (Fig. 2). Small numbers of each species were re-introduced weekly to simulate immigration and allow potential recovery from toxicity.

### Results

The copper inhibited some phytoplankton more than others and killed many grazers, especially Daphnia. The higher the concentration of copper, the longer the inhibition and mortality of organisms. By eliminating grazing, low concentrations of copper allowed more phytoplankton to develop (Fig. 3), higher concentrations of copper delayed recovery longer.

The elimination of highly-sensitive dominant organisms allowed less-sensitive organisms to increase in abundance. Within natural environments, the observation that some species increase in the presence of toxic substances has been used to discredit toxicity testing without considering the relative sensitivities of competing or predatory species.

### Outlook for further research

Because of time constraints at the time of the study, some research questions couldn't be addressed. Potential continuing research questions using the existing data are:

- Why shouldn’t CuSo4 be used to control cyanobacteria?
- What is the competition among and between phytoplankton and grazers?
- Why cyanobacteria became dominant in some experiments and the loss of Daphnia?
- Are laboratory results replicable, repeatable and reproducible?
