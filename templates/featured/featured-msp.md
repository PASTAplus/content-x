### Description

Urban agriculture is expanding globally and can recycle food waste nutrients. However, imbalanced compost application can cause nutrient losses and pollution. This dataset is a part of a larger study investigating nutrient dynamics in urban agriculture and quantifying its impact on the ecosystem in Minnesota. 

The project collected data from urban farms and community gardens and analyzed nutrient budgets and soil and leachate nutrient levels. Additionally, the research conducted a controlled experiment on compost type and application rate and simulated rainfall intensity. One of the studies aims was to estimate cumulative nutrient fluxes from urban agriculture at a city scale and provided research opportunities for undergraduate students and high school interns.

Below are some scenes from the experiment conducted between 2017-2021 at the University of St. Thomas research garden (Saint Paul, MN) to determine rates of nutrient recycling and loss from compost applied to urban gardens.
