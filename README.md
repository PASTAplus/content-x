# content-x
Repository for developing static [web-x](https://github.com/PASTAplus/web-x) content

## Web pages
Web pages (in markdown format) are organized into subdirectories of `templates/`. This directory structure mirrors that of web-x thereby enabling content-x developers to build, link, and preview pages in the same way they will be displayed on web-x. This essentially makes content-x a "development" environment of web-x.

Sub-directories of `templates/` loosely represent the main menu structure of web-x. Pages should be organized accordingly with all orphaned pages (i.e. those not linked to directly from the menu) stored in `resources/`.

## Images
`static/images/` contains images referenced in markdown pages. Use the [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) service to compress images before adding here.
